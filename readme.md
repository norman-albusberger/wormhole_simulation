# Wormhole Simulation: Spacetime Curvature and Rotation Effects

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to simulate the physical properties of wormholes, specifically their spacetime curvature, under various conditions. This includes both static and rotating wormholes, similar to Kerr black holes. The long-term objective is to explore whether wormholes could theoretically form stable structures that might be used for interstellar travel.

## Purpose of the Script

This script serves to visualize and analyze the spacetime curvature near wormholes. It simulates the effects of various parameters such as exotic matter density, wormhole radius, and angular momentum (rotation effects) on spacetime curvature. These simulations can provide insights into the stability and structure of such hypothetical wormholes.

## What the Script Does

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Spacetime Curvature Simulation**:
   - Based on Einstein's equations, the script calculates the spacetime curvature near a wormhole. The parameters of exotic matter density, wormhole radius, and angular momentum are varied.

2. **Parameter Study**:
   - The script iterates through different combinations of the above parameters to study their influence on spacetime curvature.

3. **Visualization**:
   - For each parameter combination, the script generates plots showing the spacetime curvature as a function of radial distance from the wormhole. These plots help to better understand the effects of the parameters.

4. **Incorporating Rotation Effects**:
   - The script also takes into account the angular momentum \( J \) of the wormhole to analyze the impact of rotating wormholes on spacetime curvature.

## Usage

To run the script, you will need Python and the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

After installing the dependencies, you can run the script to generate simulations and visualizations.

```bash
python wormhole_simulation.py
